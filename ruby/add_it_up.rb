#def means ruby we are creating a new method
#add_it_up is the method name
#(num1, hi, hello) are the arguments. Their names don't matter.
#To call a method you need to include the appropiate number of arguments. If you told rubythat it takes 10 args pass 10 to it
def add_it_up(num100, hi, hello)
  hi + hello + num100
end

puts add_it_up(number1, number2, number3)
